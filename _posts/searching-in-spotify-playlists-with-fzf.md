Spotify, for all it's _great_ features, does not have the functionality to
search personal playlists for songs. Before I continue my rant, here is what I
had in mind when I had started throwing things in the kitchen sink.

Most of my Spotify playlists are a bunch of albums strung together one after the
other. I rarely have mix-tape type playlists, which I only create with the
intention of playing at social gatherings, umm eventually..

This was not really a problem in the days of yonder when Spotify was just a
cool-to-have piece of social capital.
